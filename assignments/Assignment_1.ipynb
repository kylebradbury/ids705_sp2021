    "- Refresh you knowledge of probability theory including properties of random variables, probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions, estimating probabilities through counting, and key statistics such as mean and variance.\n",
    "- Revisit common linear algebra and matrix operations and concepts such as matrix multiplication, inner and outer products, inverses, the Hadamard (element-wise) product, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality, and symmetry.\n",
    "- Practice numerical programming, core to machine learning, by loading and filtering data, plotting data, vectorizing operations, profiling code speed, and debugging and optimizing performance. You will also practice computing probabilities based on simulation.\n",
    "- Develop or refresh your knowledge of Git version control, which will be a core tool used in the final project of this course\n",
    "- Apply your skills altogether through an exploratory data analysis to practice data cleaning, data manipulation, intepretation, and communication \n",
