  <h1>Final Project</h1>
  <h2>Summary and Goals</h2>
    <p>For this final project, you will work in teams to (1) identify a problem to solve or a question to answer, (2) apply machine learning techniques to conduct experiments to address the issues identified in (1), (3) rigorously evaluate the performance of your approach, and (4) clearly communicate your findings to a wide audience. The deliverables for this project are a final report, a presentation (in the form of a video) and a github repository for your project. Your team will submit a project proposal and one progress report at the midpoint of your project. During our final class meeting we will have a project video showcase and competition.</p>
    <p>Every project must have a supervised learning component to it. You are encouraged to also have unsupervised learning components for exploring your datasets.</p>

  </ol>

</div>
<div id="finalreport" class="container sec">
  <h2>Final Report</h2>

  <p>The final project report that you submit will consist of two parts: (1) a web-based project report (i.e. a website) and (2) a 5 minute video communicating the key takeaways from your project, posted on your project website.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Header</b>. Include your title, team number, and the names of each team member</li>
    <li><b>Abstract</b>. [150 words maximum] This should be the one paragraph that captures the significance of what you did and why you did it.</li>
    <li><b>Introduction</b>. Provide a description of the problem and the value in finding a solution, motivate your reader as to why he/she should care about this question. The idea is to get your reader excited about the solution you are about to present.</li>
    <li><b>Background</b>. This section should cite problems that have been previously addressed that relate to your work, and the key takeaways of the studies that explored that work. The idea here is to place the problem you’re working on in context and to let the reader know that you’re not working in a knowledge vacuum. For finding relevant literature, a good starting point is Google Scholar.</li>
    <li><b>Data</b>. Describe and visualize your data. Make sure every caption fully describes the figure.  You may want to visualize the raw data and/or extracted features. What challenges are inherent to this problem? How might they be overcome?  What take away messages can you get simply from visualizing your data?</li>
    <li><b>Methods</b>. Present your machine learning solution (a description of any preprocessing, feature extraction, classification/regression techniques) and why you made each of the choices you did. Discuss any methods that you didn’t create yourself and please cite relevant literature to support your claims. Also include a flow chart of your methodology to the reader can easily conceptualize your solution. The flow chart of the overall experimental design should clearly articulate your process (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016106/figures/1">example</a>). Additionally, for multiple experimental conditions or applications, they should each be represented in your flowchart. Describe your approach to measuring generalization performance, what metric(s) you used and why. Imagine that you are writing this section so that someone could recreate your results.</li>
    <li><b>Results</b>. Include a complete performance assessment that includes your validation approach (cross validation, train/validate/test split, etc.) and the key metrics of performance for the problem (ROC curves, PR curves, confusion matrices if applicable, etc.). You should also compare your outcomes to at least one baseline model (a simple model to exhibit your improvements) in addition to comparison against random chance guessing in the classification setting. This section should be supported with visualizations including examples where your method worked well, examples where it failed, and hypotheses supported by evidence as to why in each case.</li>
    <li><b>Conclusions</b>. It’s critical to have a strong ending and not just let the energy fizzle out of the report. Many readers, if pressed for time, will simply read your abstract and your conclusions. In fact, you may want to start by writing your conclusions. Very succinctly recap the problem you were studying and what was your approach to the solution. Focus on explaining the key takeaways from your work - these should not be merely a set of bullet points, but fleshed out conclusions. As you're writing your conclusions think about if the reader took nothing else away from reading your report, what would you want them to know most? Did you identify one particular approach that worked well? Was there a challenge that you faced that opens the door to working on solving a new problem? What avenues of research would you pursue next?</li>
    <li><b>Roles</b>. Since this is a team project, we want to know what your specific contribution was to this project. Provide detail on your individual role and how it contributed to the competition. Each team member should clearly articulate an individual role.</li>
    <li><b>Timeline of activity</b>. This timeline articulates the various milestones for your project and demonstrates consistent effort over the course of the project from the time of the proposal through submission. This can be a bulleted list with milestones and completion dates and should simply be a compiled list from the individual in the project coordinator role collected from weekly meetings.</li> 
    <li><b>References</b> [no word limits]. An alphabetical list of references cited in this work. A minimum of 15 are required. Consider using the Zotero citation manager for collecting and compiling your references. These should primarily be research papers and technical reports.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You will submit your report via Gradescope and should meet the following requirements</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Word limit: your report should be no longer than 2,500 words, not including references and figure captions</li>
    <li>Figures are highly encouraged, and should each be referenced in the text (such that every figure has a clear point to the story that you tell). Every figure should have a caption, figure number, axis labels (with units if applicable), and legend, if applicable. If you use any figures that are not your own, they should be cited as well. No figure should be superfluous - every figure should be referenced in the text. </li>
    <li>While the specific citation format is not critical, it should be consistent and follow a known model (MLA, IEEE, Chicago, APA, etc.).</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Examples to emulate for project webpages:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://distill.pub/">Distll.pub</a> In my opinion, this is the BEST online interactive machine learning journal.</li>
    <li><a href="https://devseed.com/ml-grid-docs/">Identifying transmission lines in satellite imagery assisted by machine learning</a>Excellent short project overview that provides and example of how web formats can be created </li>

  </ul>

</div>
<div id="video" class="container sec">
  <h2>Video</h2>

  <p>You will also submit an up-to-5 minute video summarizing your project. This video should be visually compelling and should not miss the “forest for the trees” – don’t get lost in technical details, this video is NOT the place for extreme technical detail, but instead for CLEARLY conveying the big picture of your problem/question and your solution/answer or in conveying the core concept you’re trying to teach. Imagine your aunt and uncle watching this video – would they know what’s going on? Would they find it interesting / engaging / compelling? For inspiration for what makes a good explanatory video, watch videos from the following series:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg">Two Minute Papers</a> by Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Concise 1-4 minute summaries of cutting edge research papers.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a> by Grant Sanderson. Mathematical concepts conveyed clearly, intuitively, and visually.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UConVfxXodg78Tzh5nNu85Ew">Welch Labs</a> by Stephen Welch. Series on machine learning, neural networks, and imaginary numbers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once you're working on producing your video, ask your friends (especially those who may not be as technically inclined) for feedback. Do they think it was engaging/easy to follow/enjoyable to watch? Ask them their takeaways: did they get the message you were trying to communicate? Address their feedback to help you ensure the quality of your video. You're encouraged to use the audio-visual medium to the fullest to clearly present your project.</p>

  <p>You'll submit your video as a .mp4 file to the instructional team (please test your file to make sure it plays before submitting).</p>
</div>

<div id="rolesresponsibilities" class="container sec">
    
  <h2>Roles & Responsibilities</h2>

  <p>Each member of your team will articulate clearly specified, complementary roles. Each team member will have four responsibilities:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Individual report contributions</li>
    <li>Individual project management contributions</li>
    <li>Machine learning experimental condition contribution</li>
    <li>Team support</li>
  </ol>

  <p>For the individual contributions of roles 1-3, each team member selects one of the roles listed below in each section (only one per team member)</p>

  <p>We'll walk through each of these four roles.</p>

  <h3>Role #1: Individual report contribution</h3>
  <p>The team will select one member of the team to take on each of the following technical roles (a fifth role only being required for teams of 5).</p>
  <p><i>Please note: these recommended roles are meant to generally guide your assignments of roles within the team. You can modify these to meet the needs of your team, but each role should have a clearly distinguishable output that they are responsible for and this should be articulated in your project proposal.</i></p>

This is more than a restatement of the results, but interprets the results and places them in the context of other work or potential impact on application domains. Conclusions must be grounded in the results from the work, attuned to the contributions of the project and are based on the background literature.

  <h3>Role #3: Executing a machine learning experimental condition</h3>

  <p><i>Every member of the team is required to train and apply a machine learning algorithm some of the data for the project.</i> This will typically be an experimental condition for the project and responsible for writing up their assessment of the results of that experiment. Every member of the team will have a personal piece to work on related to apply the techniques from the course to the project.</p>

  <h3>Role #4: Supporting your teammates on achieving project success</h3>

  <p>While the above roles are detailed to provide your team with structure (much like you are likely to receive as work assignments on a job), these roles are meant to empower you to accomplish more together. Not ever possible scenario or requirement of this project is covered by one of the above roles (although the coverage is quite high). The most important aspect of a successful team project is to be there to support one another. Be generous with your time as you're able and always be respectful. </p>

<div id="evaluation" class="container sec">
  <h2>Evaluation</h2>

  <p>The expectation of this project is to apply the techniques that you learned from this course to your application. Following the methodologies we discussed carefully, exercising rigor in ensuring the correct interpretation of your results, and clearly and accurately communicating those results is what is key to success. It's OK if the results and your algorithm's performance are not exceptional, as long as you followed the procedures we outlined carefully to ensure that you have produced results, that your results are trustworthy, and you properly interpreted your findings. You're encouraged to reach out to the instructional team regularly for questions about your project as they arise.</p>

Automating building identification could help map global population and analyze global population growth in real-time. However, different parts of the world look different: forests, deserts, plains, etc. Each location looks differently. This may impact the ability to train an algorithm on one location and test on another location. This project uses the INRIA building dataset to investigate the impact of different geographies on the performance of building detection and segmentation techniques using satellite imagery.</p>

  <h2>Dataset Ideas</h2>
  <p><b>What makes for an interesting dataset to explore?</b> The dataset generally needs to have enough samples, features, and labels to enable a meaningful analysis. This rules out options like the Iris, Titanic, and all other "introductory" datasets for which you can find dozens of numerous tutorials walking through the analysis. You want to be able to journey into the unknown of the data: be bold and pick a dataset and application that excites you!</p>
